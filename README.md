# Calculator Fiz

Calculator is a simple 4 function calculator, with a panel that has more advanced functions when you need them. It includes history, real time graphing, base conversion, and more. It also comes with a lockscreen widget, a floating calculator, and a wear app so you can use whichever is most convenient.

The goal is a simple and uncluttered calculator.

Because Calculator is a full replacement for your stock calculator, we recommend you disable the one that came with your phone. If you long press your original calculator.
